# Online-Code-Editor

Online Code Editor is a free and open-source online real-time code editor that lets you develop, execute, and test code in C and Python. It'll be ideal for anyone who wants to quickly write and run code without having to launch a full-featured IDE on their PC. Furthermore, it can be used by businesses to recruit software professionals. This will make it easier for firms to administer these tests and assess candidates based on how well their code performs when tested against some test cases.

This full-stack web application's goal is to give an instant online coding and testing platform as well as practise coding problems.

This project is based on MERN stack. MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node, after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

- MongoDB — document database
- Express(.js) — Node.js web framework
- React(.js) — a client-side JavaScript framework
- Node(.js) — the premier JavaScript web server
